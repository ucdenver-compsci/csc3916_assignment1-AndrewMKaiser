# Assignment One

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/32618110-171f262d-acc8-4eb3-be1c-6d622c6da71d?action=collection%2Ffork&source=rip_markdown&collection-url=entityId%3D32618110-171f262d-acc8-4eb3-be1c-6d622c6da71d%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3D25a21ecb-e4db-4aed-b0dd-8e4e945cb7f0)

- Note:

    When running the collection through the Postman desktop application, the response time was reliably under 100ms. However, when using the web version, it was reliably above 250ms.

    Keep in mind Render may spin down the server due to using the free tier, which may cause responsed to be longer.
